A class that implements a fast algorithm for computing a multiple point of an elliptic curve.

Implemented by:
- Function of generating an elliptical curve in the form of a Montgomery
- Translation from the Montgomery form to the Weirstrass form and back
- Arithmetic operations in the form of a Montgomery (with the Montgomery Ladder)
